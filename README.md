# Daron Schmit's Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description 

In this project, I focused on making a portfolio for myself using Bootstrap, which had a responsive layouts and images when viewed on smaller screens (such as on mobile) while using minimal media queries (thanks bootstrap!). I also focused on making a functional navbar that worked on desktop and mobile.

## Installation

You can download all these files here: https://github.com/DaronSchmit/DaronBootstrapPortfolio/archive/main.zip and open index.html in your favorite browser (chrom preferred) to get started. You can also feel free to use your favorite text editor to take a peek under the hood. 

Additionally, you can skip the downloading and go straight to  https://daronschmit.github.io/DaronBootstrapPortfolio/portfolio.html to see the webpage deployed live. You can then use the inspect tool to see the page's innards in-browser. 


## Usage 

This webpage has a functional navbar with changing font color based on what page you're in!
